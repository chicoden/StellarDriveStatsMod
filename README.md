# ðŸš§ Build Instructions
## Required
- Visual Studio 2022
- Python 3.12

## Steps
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the FrameStats solution in Visual Studio 2022 and build the solution (Build > Build Solution)
3. Download StellarDrive 0.6.5 from https://curious-owl-dev.itch.io/stellardrive

# Mod Instructions
*this mod is in its infancy and most interesting information is in the log window right now \
When running StellarDrive (StellarDrive_0.6.5/StellarDrive.exe), you should see a window with logs from the mod
as well as some additional features in the game window that are added by the mod:
- ~~Enable performance stats checkbox in the options menu~~
- ~~A panel in the top right corner showing FPS, CPU/GPU temperature, RAM usage, etc. (if enabled in options)~~

## Notes
- You may need to run StellarDrive as administrator for the mod to be able to access certain performance metrics (on my machine for example, administrator privileges are needed to read CPU temperature and clock frequency)
